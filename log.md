# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed the whole HTML5 and CSS portion in about an hour.

**Thoughts:** I felt good about how well I knew this stuff and even was able to pick up some good practices that I will definitly use in the future.  Looking forward to tomorrow. 

### Day 2: January 8th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed the whole Responsive Design and Bootstrap portion in about an hour.

**Thoughts:** I've used bootstrap a bunch but this really broke it down nicely for me. Really started to grasp the whole div class and row class thing. 

### Day 3: January 9th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed jquery and set up my Code Pen account

**Thoughts:** Pretty Cool, I never wrote in JS before. Got a little confusing but i figured it out. Looking forward to more JS stuff.
