# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed the whole HTML5 and CSS portion in about an hour.

**Thoughts:** I felt good about how well I knew this stuff and even was able to pick up some good practices that I will definitly use in the future.  Looking forward to tomorrow. 

### Day 2: January 8th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed the whole Responsive Design and Bootstrap portion in about an hour.

**Thoughts:** I've used bootstrap a bunch but this really broke it down nicely for me. Really started to grasp the whole div class and row class thing. 

### Day 3: January 9th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed jquery and set up my Code Pen account

**Thoughts:** Pretty Cool, I never wrote in JS before. Got a little confusing but i figured it out. Looking forward to more JS stuff.

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Tribute Page on CodePen.io. Check it out: https://codepen.io/Bdwyz/full/vpRbbP/. 

**Thoughts:** First time working on Code Pen but I got the hang of it. deff coded for more then an hour today but I feel like I'm starting to memorize the code now. feels good to code fluently. 

### Day 5: January 11th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Started working on my personal portfolio page. Basically didnt get past the header because of all the fun I was having. 

**Thoughts:** It was nice, not having any restrictions and being able to just design what I wanna design. really started to fool around with the CSS stuff and prob got a little too carried away but it helping me learn. 

### Day 6: January 12th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Set up my CSS grid on my personal portfolio page.  

**Thoughts:** Didnt really have a lot of time today so I had Nicole drive while I did my 1 hour of code in the car. Got it done, getting the hang of the css grid. 

### Day 7: January 13th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Still trying to figure out these grids and trying to set up sticky anchor links.

**Thoughts:** Got home late but had to code at least for an hour. Got it done feel good but im gonna be shot in the AM. Also I think im gonna have to use JS for the go to top links.
